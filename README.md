# scala-web-sbt-spring-jsp-register-rsa-encrypted-bcrypt-encode

## Description
A springboot secure web app with jsp support.
Three roles are defined; USER, ADMIN, and SUPER. All roles
can access pages `/home`, `/login`, and `/about`. Only USER
can access `/user` and ADMIN only `/admin` whereas SUPER can
navigate to either and have its own `/super`. Each role
has an action USER=VIEW ONLY, ADMIN=READ/WRITE, SUPER=CREATE.
All password are encrypted with RSA and encoded with bcrypt
to insure strong passwords.

The encrypted text is 512 in length when compressed ~ 306.
To compress the encrypted text gzip was used.

When storing a password it is best practice
to use a one-way hash such as bcrypt, bcrypt,
or argon2.
